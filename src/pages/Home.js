    return <p>I'm a software engineer making a career change from the automotive sector and looking for a team based environment to learn about my craft and express myself creatively. In the automotive sector my ability to methodically diagnose issues, split my time and energy among multiple projects and explain complex concepts in a way the customer could digest and understand was tested on a daily basis. As well as being trusted not only with shop tools and equipment, but with customer vehicles and possessions. I hope to bring the skills and values that drove my success in the automotive sector to a team where I can learn and take pride in my craft. As well as express my creativity in a manner that adds to the user experience.</p>;
